# Sandbox-project
A project with many things, a sandbox

Ah yes, this is the description. So this project is a sandbox. And you can put whatever project you want on this.
However, for each project you make, I ask you to make a seperate branch and not put it on the main. That's all.
For the commits, I will not grant you access unless I know you or trust you. Sorry, but this is to mitigate the 
risk of vandals. Thank you for reading this file.
